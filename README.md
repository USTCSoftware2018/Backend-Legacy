## What is Biohub?

[Biohub](https://github.com/igemsoftware2016/USTC-Software-2016) is a web-based software authored by USTC Software 2016, focusing on more convenient data handling for synthetic biologists. Technically Biohub is a extensible plugin system, where each functional module is packed and integrated as a plugin. Several plugins (Pano, PathFinder, etc.) are initially included, but users are also allowed to develop and deploy their own plugins, with the help of documentation and demonstration. In this way, new algorithms can be acquainted and discussed by other scholars as early as possible.

## What is Biohub 2.0?

Biohub 2.0 is a synthetic biology community, focusing on more efficient data retrieving and ideas sharing. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with standard biological parts, or BioBricks in short. With the help of a high-performance search backend and well-designed filtering and ordering algorithms, users can obtain information of the parts they want more precisely. For those interest them, users may leave a mark (called a 'Star') for later using. If one has already use a part in practice, he or she may grade the part, or post an article (called an 'Experience') to share ideas. Experiences can also be voted or discussed. All the data collected (rating scores, number of stars, etc.) will be used for more accurating filtering and ordering.

More than a community, Biohub 2.0 is also a flexible plugin system. A plugin is an optional and pluggable module that can be integrated into the software and take advantage of all the internal data. Plugin developers can either use BioBricks data for further analysis, or just implement a synthetic biological algorithm for the community. There is no specific restriction about the code of plugins, but they will be preapproved before installed into the system as a consideration of security. By default, two plugins, ABACUS and BioCircuit, are available as two handy tools and, in a sense, some kinds of demonstration.

Despite of the similarity in their names, Biohub 2.0 has less common points compared with Biohub. The two projects differ largely in their emphasis and implementation. The only thing Biohub 2.0 borrows from Biohub is the idea of the plugin system, which is further improved and implemented in a more stable way. The name 'Biohub' is inspired by another active developer community Github, which is very suitable for a biology community but was previously used. For disambiguation, the project is named Biohub 2.0.
